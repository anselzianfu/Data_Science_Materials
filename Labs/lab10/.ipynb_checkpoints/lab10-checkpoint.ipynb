    "## The Bootstrap Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap is a very simple process: \n",
    "* Sample with replacement from the original sample (now the **bootstrap population**). These samples are called **bootstrap samples**. We typically take thousands of bootstrap samples (~10,000 is common).\n",
    "* Calculate the statistic of interest for each bootstrap sample. This statistic is called the **bootstrap statistic**, and the empirical distribution of these bootstrap statistics is an approximation to the **sampling distribution** of the bootstrapped statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why bootstrap instead of just calculating the statistic of interest once on the whole sample? \n",
    "\n",
    "Take sample mean estimator as an example. Suppose $\\{x_i\\}$ are samples coming from an unknown distribution. We can use sample mean $\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ to estimate the the mean of the population. However, if we obtain another sample set $\\{x_i\\}$, we can get very different results. Therefore, computing the sampling distribution (distribution of the sample mean for all possible sample sets) would be very helpful. From such distribution, we can also obtain the bias of this estimator: $E (\\bar{X}) - \\mu$, and the variance of the estimator: $E[E(\\bar{X})-\\bar{X}]^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute the sampling distribution of $\\bar{X}$, we could directly use sampling methods. But that requires us to obtain several different sets of samples $\\{x_i\\}$ directly from the population. If we have $m$ sets of samples and each set contains $n$ subjects (totaling $m*n$ subjects), we can then use $ \\hat{X} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^m \\bar{X_j}$ to approximate $E(\\bar{X})$, and $\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^m (\\hat{X} - \\bar{X_j})^2$ to approximate $E[E(\\bar{X})-\\bar{X}]^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in reality, this is often unfeasible, and we only have one set of samples (**bootstrap population**). Therefore we can use bootstrap method to resample (sample with replacement) from the **bootstrap population** to obtain $m$ different **bootstrap samples**, each **bootstrap sample** has the same amount of data as in **bootstrap population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we sample with replacement?\n",
    "Recall that we are trying to mimic the ideal scenario of directly sampling from the original population. In the case where each bootstrap sample has the same amount of data as the bootstrap population, sampling without replacement would cause every bootstrap sample to be identical to the bootstrap population. Even when the bootstrap samples have less samples that the bootstrap population, sampling without replacement would cause the samples to be *based on the original sample*. Instead, sampling with replacement causes our bootstrap samples to be *based on the distribution of the original sample* (which we assume is representative of the original population)."

Otherwise, bootstrap samples just need to have an equal (and reasonable) amount of data. Why do you think bootstrap sample size needs to meet this additional restriction for these applications?
