The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

If `data_dir/file` already and exists `force=False`, nothing is downloaded, and instead a message is printed letting you know the date of the cached file.\n",

How many occurrences of each value is in the DataFrame? What are the implications for further analysis?
